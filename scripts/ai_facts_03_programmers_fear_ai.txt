Programmers are not scared of AI.
They are scared of bad AI.

Because code is not just typing.
It is responsibility.
One wrong line can leak data.
Crash a system.
Or drain money.

AI can write code fast.
But speed is not the hard part.
The hard part is knowing what to build.
And what can break.

Here’s the real fear.
A beginner will copy AI code.
Ship it.
And never test it.
Then the bug looks “mysterious.”
But it was predictable.

So how do smart developers use AI?
They use it like a junior teammate.
Great for drafts.
Great for options.
Great for explanations.

But the final decision stays human.
Review.
Tests.
Security checks.

AI won’t replace programmers.
But programmers who can direct AI will replace programmers who can’t.

If AI wrote 80% of your code,
what would you do with the extra time?
