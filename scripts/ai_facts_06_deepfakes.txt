In 2026, seeing is not believing.

Deepfakes can copy a face.
Copy a voice.
And put words in someone’s mouth.

The scary part?
It does not need a Hollywood studio.
A few seconds of audio can be enough.

So how do you protect yourself?
First, slow down.
Deepfakes work because they create urgency.
“Send money now.”
“Do this fast.”

Second, verify with a second channel.
If you get a voice call,
message the person on another app.
Ask a question only they would know.

Third, look for context.
Where did the clip come from?
Who posted it?
Is there an original source?

Technology keeps getting better.
So trust needs upgrades too.

If a video of you existed that you never recorded,
how would you prove it is fake?
