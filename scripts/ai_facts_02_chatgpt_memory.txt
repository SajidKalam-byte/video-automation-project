Your AI might remember you.
Even when you forget it.

Some assistants can store “memory” about your preferences.
Like your job.
Your writing style.
Or what you are building.
That means future answers can be more personal.
And more useful.

But here’s the tradeoff.
Memory is power.
Because small details can reveal a lot.
Your city.
Your schedule.
Your plans.
Even your weak spots.

So what should you do?
Never put secrets in chat.
No passwords.
No OTPs.
No private keys.
No confidential client data.

Use a simple rule.
If you would not paste it in a public document,
do not paste it into an AI.

And if you do want memory,
keep it boring.
Like: “I prefer short answers.”
That’s safe.

If an AI could remember one thing about you forever,
what would you want it to be?
