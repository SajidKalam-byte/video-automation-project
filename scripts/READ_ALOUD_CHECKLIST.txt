Read-Aloud Checklist (60 seconds max)

Score each 0–2:
1) Hook: made me stop in 2 seconds
2) Clarity: zero jargon, easy English
3) Pace: short sentences, no tongue-twisters
4) Value: at least 2–3 concrete facts
5) Curiosity: strong final question

Quick fixes:
- If hook is weak: add a shocking contrast ("You think X. It's actually Y.")
- If too long: delete one example, keep the best
- If too complex: replace technical terms with simple words
- If flat: add one specific number or real scenario
