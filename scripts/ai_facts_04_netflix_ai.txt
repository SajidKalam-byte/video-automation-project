Netflix knows what you will watch.
Before you do.

It is not magic.
It is prediction.
Every click teaches the system.
What you start.
What you finish.
What you quit in 2 minutes.

Then it ranks videos for you.
Not by “best movie.”
By “best for you.”

Even the thumbnail can change.
You and your friend can see different images.
Same show.
Different cover.
Because Netflix tests what makes you click.

The goal is simple.
Reduce the time you spend searching.
Increase the time you spend watching.

That is why recommendations feel personal.
They are trained on patterns.
Not feelings.

Next time you open Netflix,
notice how fast you pick something.
That speed is the algorithm winning.

If an algorithm controls your choices,
how do you know they are still your choices?
