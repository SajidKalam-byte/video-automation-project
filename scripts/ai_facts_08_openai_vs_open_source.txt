The biggest AI war is not model versus model.
It is closed versus open.

Closed models can be very strong.
But you cannot inspect them.
You trust the provider.

Open-source models can be smaller.
But you can run them locally.
On your machine.
No internet.
More privacy.
More control.

So which one wins?
Depends on your goal.
If you want maximum performance today,
closed models often lead.
If you want customization and ownership,
open-source is powerful.

Here’s the real twist.
The best teams use both.
Closed for speed.
Open for sensitive data.

AI is becoming like operating systems.
Some people want convenience.
Some people want freedom.

If you could only choose one for a year,
would you pick power or control?
