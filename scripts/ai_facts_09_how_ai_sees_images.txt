AI does not see pictures like you.
It sees patterns in numbers.

An image becomes a grid of pixels.
Pixels become values.
Then the model learns shapes.
Edges.
Textures.
And relationships.

That is why AI can recognize a cat.
Even if the cat is upside down.
Or in bad lighting.

But this also explains failures.
Small changes can confuse it.
A sticker on a stop sign.
A weird shadow.
A slightly different angle.

So when people say “AI sees,”
it is a shortcut.
It is not vision.
It is math.

This matters for safety.
Because the world is messy.
And math models love clean patterns.

If AI can be fooled by a tiny sticker,
how should we trust it in real life?
